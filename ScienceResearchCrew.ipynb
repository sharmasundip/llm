      "Artificial Intelligence (AI) refers to the development of computer systems that can perform tasks typically requiring human intelligence, such as learning, problem-solving, decision-making, and perception. Coined in 1956 by John McCarthy, AI has made significant progress since the 1980s and 1990s. Today, AI is a rapidly growing field with applications in healthcare, finance, education, and entertainment.\n",
